# Creative Coding Demos

Welcome to the Creative Coding Demos repository.

Most of our articles can have code snippets and code embbeds from popular platforms like CodeSandbox.io. But some of our articles benefit from having a "final" demo and source code. This repository hosts the demos and source code running on https://demos.creative-coding.com

## Contributing

Contributing to this repository is reserved to the Creative Coding Authors. If you are not yet an author and you would like to contribute please visit creative-coding.com/about and click on the "Become an Author" link and follow the on-screen instructions.

If you're already an author and you want to upload a demo, simply fork this repo, duplicate the template and rename it to your own unique name and submit a pull request.

Though you can upload whatever content you want, please remember that is beneficial to our readers code readability vs performance. Though javascript is a flexible language we also encourage using modules, imports, const/let and arrow funtions. Any comments on the code are most welcome.

## Branding

All the demos featured on Creative Coding through the demos.creative-coding.com domain need to have CC branding on. Pull Request where the branding has been removed will not be accepted.
